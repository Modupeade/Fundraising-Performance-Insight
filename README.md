### Tools and Technologies Used
  - Power BI â€“ For data visualization and report creation.
  - Power Query â€“ For data transformation and cleaning.
  - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ For creating custom calculations and measures.
  - Excel â€“ For initial data exploration.

### Data Preparation
1. Data Cleaning: Data has no missing values and duplicates, and data types was formatted using Power Query.
2. Data Transformation: Standardized column names, created calculated columns, and applied data normalization where necessary.

### Data Analysis 
Using DAX Measures & Calculations

Response rate
  ```
  ResponseRate = DIVIDE([CountContactReference], SUM('Segment Matrix'[Mailing Count]))
  ```
  - Calculates the response rate.
    
ROI
  ```
 ROI = ([TotalIncome] - SUM('Segment Matrix'[Segment Cost]))/SUM('Segment Matrix'[Segment Cost])
  ```
  - Calculate ROI

- High Attrition in Life Sciences & Medical Educational Fields: Employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical education fields are more likely to leave the company, possibly due to job dissatisfaction or workload-related challenges.
- Impact of Age Band and Gender: Employees aged between 31-40, particularly males, have the highest attrition rate.
- Marital Status Influence: Single males exhibit a significantly higher attrition rate compared to divorced employees.
